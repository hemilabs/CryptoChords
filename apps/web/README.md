# CryptoChords Web App
This is the web application of the CryptoChords project. It is a front-end application that allows users to visualize activities on the [Hemi network](https://hemi.xyz).

## Architecture
It is built using DDD principles with the following layers:
- Application
- Domain
- Infrastructure
- Presentation

### Application
This layer contains the use cases of the application. It is the entry point of the application and it is responsible for coordinating the domain layer and the infrastructure layer.

### Domain
This layer contains the business logic of the application. It is the core of the application and it is responsible for the entities, value objects, and domain services.

### Infrastructure
This layer contains the implementation of the application. It is responsible for the database and the external services.

### Presentation
This layer contains the user interface of the application.

#### Presenters
This sublayer contains the presenters of the application. It is responsible for the whole user interface logic.

#### React
This sublayer contains the React implementation of the application. Its components are responsible for the style and the interface with the presenters, displaying its state and redirecting the user actions.
